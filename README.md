# Musi to YouTube Playlist
**This is a python script that converts a Musi Playlist (mobile app) to a YouTube Playlist**

**In order for this script to work, you will need:**
- The Client Secrets File

**In order to get the Client Secrets File follow the following steps:** <br/>
1.) Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome) <br/>
2.) Create a new product <br/>
3.) Create an API Key and OAuth ID and generate the .json file <br/>
4.) Move the .json file to the project directory and rename it "client_secrets.json" (or change variable name in the script)<br/>
5.) Insert the Musi Playlist URL in the variable 'playlist_url' <br/>
6.) Run the script and check your YouTube account to see if the playlist has been generated <br/>
